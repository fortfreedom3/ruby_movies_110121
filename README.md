# Deliverables
Add migrations relationships. Our tickets should belong to one movie, a movie can have many tickets. We want some new models for managing our snack stand at the movie theater. A receipt can have many receipt_line_items, and many foods through receipt_line_items. A food can have many receipt_line_items, and many receipts through receipt_line_items. ReceiptLineItem will be the join model.
