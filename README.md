0. Clone down the starter code and run bundle and migrate. Verify your migration was successful. Review your models to verify the associations are set up correctly. Create some seeds manually or using the faker gem.  


1. In ApplicationController create a GET route for Movies. Run your server with `bundle exec rerun -b 'rackup config.ru'` if you haven't already. Verify your route in the browser at `http://localhost:9292/movies`.
